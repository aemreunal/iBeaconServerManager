iBeaconServerManager
====================

A GUI interface for managing the iBeacon server. It was written in a very short time and the code is beyond ugly.

WARNING: The app stores the default user account info (username/password) in plain text (the 8th deadly sin). 1) I'm sorry 2) Be aware of this fact and make sure that you don't leak it in some way.
